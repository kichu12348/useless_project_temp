This project is a collection of quirky and pointless web experiences designed to cure boredom and provide endless, useless entertainment. It includes features that range from infinite scrolling and cat philosophy to progress bars that never quite make it to 100%.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
